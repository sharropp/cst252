        <p>Hello! I'm Holden Ivashin (he/him), a sophomore pursuing a major in Communication Design with a Visual Design concentration at California State University, Monterey Bay. I'm a bow-tie enthusiast and long-time Doctor Who fan from Danville, California, who enjoys gaming, Vocaloid music, and anime (plus other niche things!) In my free time I dabble in all kinds of digital art and media projects, from illustration to audio manipulation to video editing.</p>
<p>I started out making comic strips, home videos, and LEGO stop motion films. Over time I fell in love with making videos, especially the film and sound editing aspects, and took several classes to refine my skills. I enjoyed the process of assembling a set of clips together to build meaningful films from a bunch of "pieces", though those projects grew tiring over time.</p>
<p>It was during the COVID-19 pandemic, however, that I underwent a transitional period, taking an art and animation course through which I rediscovered the joy of illustration from drawing comics back in my youth. This course also exposed me to Photoshop and image editing, pushing me to join my highschool yearbook team in Senior year. This was my first experience with design, and I took great pride in creating template layouts for spreads and becoming the Graphic Editor.</p><p>My joy and success with my work for the yearbook is what inspired me to pursue CSUMB’s unique Communication Design degree, where I have not only begun to learn the theory and fundamentals of artistic design (from color to form), but also how to apply these concepts to technical, practical uses in industry (from web design to motion graphics).
</p><p>I am still searching for my niche in the wider world of design, but I feel it has become my current creative home. I'm always working hard to put out my best work, and I hope that, at the very least, I can create something that makes a difference in people’s lives, whether it inspires an environmental movement or simply makes someone smile.
