After a long period of art “burnout”, I created a series of rough sketches, some developing into polished pieces, to force myself to draw freely instead of locking myself into a mindset where every line I draw must be the perfect shape and thickness. The result of this loose, free drawing are some of my favorite pieces that I have created, capturing the elements I love in my sketches into surprisingly polished pieces. It surprised me what I could create with a different mindset and with this freedom I felt motivated to explore new techniques, like playing with line thickness and foreshortening. These pieces depict several Japanese anime characters from Vocaloid, Bocchi the Rock!, and Madoka Magica.

                    While my character drawing and line art has improved in recent pieces, I feel these sketches, in which I practiced various art techniques and skills, still hold up. The first piece, depicting a British police box from Doctor Who, was a study of two point perspective, which establishes a darker, moody feel through its colors. I also enjoy the composition of this piece, how the light and shadows are rendered, and how I abstracted the brick texture. The second piece is an exploration of abstract composition and color, which was not planned out or sketched and just formed from experimentation and layering with different brushes. The third piece, depicting a Japanese anime character from Chainsaw Man, was a practice with line thickness and color harmony, with the range of line thickness helping to communicate a sense of depth and motion amongst the exciting colors. I think all these pieces show some of the artistic ability and understanding I have outside of purely character drawing (which I tend to fixate on).
