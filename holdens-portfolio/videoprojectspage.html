          <p class="video-description">This short video film is a highlight reel of various film, special effects, design, image editing, and animation projects I completed over the course of a semester. While I feel these projects were impressive (such as a spinning donut I created in Blender), I equally tried to present these projects in an engaging manner that showcased my video editing and after effects skills, including blurring the background of shots that did not fill the screen and making labels and icons wobble and zoom in and out of frame. I also wove together some difficult transitions using in-camera and post production effects, such as when I flip the camera towards my computer in the intro sequence.</p>

        <p class="video-description">This group project tasked my teammates and I with creating a short overview tour of the CSUMB Campus. While it was hard to cram everything we wanted to discuss into a single video, I feel we documented a lot of different areas that make our college a great place to live and study. I was responsible for editing the film, including the motion graphics and used towards the beginning of the film to zoom into campus from an aerial map and animate the title and credits. I also helped to script and storyboard the film and suggested how we could film a few shots, though most of my changes to shots (including reversing them at times) came in the editing process.</p>
