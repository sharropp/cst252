				<h5>Our Task</h5>
				  <p>Task 1 was to pseudocode a simple task or card game. We chose to pseudocode the game wordle. Wordle is a game where every day, a five-letter word is chosen which players aim to guess within six tries. After every guess, each letter is marked as either green, yellow or gray. Green indicates that the letter is correct and in the correct position. Yellow means it is in the word but not in the right position, while gray indicates it is not in the word at all. Multiple instances of the

					<h5>The Questions</h5>
					<p> Before pseudocoding you must ask yourself four questions: 1. What actions can I take?, 2. What do I need to remember or keep track of?, 3. What do I do over and over again?, 4. and When do I need to make decisions?. </p>
					<p> we answered the questions like this</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Come up with a 5 letter word and input it</li>
						<li>If the letters you input are marked green yellow or gray</li>
						<li>Inputting 5 letter words </li>
						<li>Based on the green and yellow letters make a new guess including the correct letters and some new ones</li>
					</ul>

					<h5>The Pseudocode Process</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>1. Create a 5 letter word from English Dictionary</li>
						<li>2. Test for a win, errors, and correct letter placements </li>
						<li>3. If not a win try again with another 5 letter word with correct letter placements and errors in mind</li>
						<li>4. Repeat until no more tries or win</li>
